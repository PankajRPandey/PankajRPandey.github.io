## This is a modified version of a clean Resume template [Start Bootstrap - Resume](https://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/resume/)

</br>

# New features
I've customised the Resume to use the Carribbean Green `#02d783` as the primary color along with some other new features listed below : 
- Dark Mode at the Operating System Level
```css
@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
  body,
  .mb-0,
  .mb-5,
  .text-dark {
      color: #ffffff !important;
      background: #121212;
  }
}
```
- Address bar theme color change (Works only on Chrome for Android in Light mode)
```html
<meta name="theme-color" content="#02d783">
```
